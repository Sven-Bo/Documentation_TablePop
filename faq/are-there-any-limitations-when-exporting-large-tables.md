# Are there any limitations when exporting large tables?

Yes. TablePop can export large Excel tables, but there are practical limits.

If your table has many thousands of rows or many columns, the export will still work, but a few things can happen:

• The export can take a few seconds\
• The generated HTML file can become very large\
• Very large HTML tables can feel slow or unresponsive in the browser

For **very large datasets, TablePop is not recommended**. It works best for small to medium sized tables where fast loading and smooth interaction matter.
